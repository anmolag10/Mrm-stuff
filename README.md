## Tennis Ball Detection
Detecting tennis balls using OpenCV using various methods
  # HoughCircle
   Detection by comparing the areas of the minimum enclosing circle and the hough circle.
  # AspectRatio
   Detection based on the following comparisons:
   1. Areas of contour and minimum enclosing circle.
   2. Centroids of contour and minimum enclosing circle.
   3. Value of Aspect ratio of bounding rectangle.
   
#  Contour and Solidity
   Detection by comparing the areas of the contour and the hough circle. 
   Similar to aspectratio but also checks solidity.
